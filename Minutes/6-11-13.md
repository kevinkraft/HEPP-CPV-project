Fifth meeting

What we've done
---------------
John - B meson detection BaBar, uniqueness of detector, technical aspects, sole purpose or making B mesons, B factories, Tagging, female fashion blog, CKM theory and findings descrepency, B mixing
Sinead - cosmology applications, big bang model justified, naive models has symmetry, ~10^-4 ratio, Baryogenesis conditions, lepton genesis not sure, CP search in gamma ray sky FERMI LAT, different spectrum backgrounds, helicity? non trivial, electroweak baryogenesis Barygenesis!Barygenesis!Barygenesis!
Kevin - Sick, so apologies, should have no trouble and no distractions this weekend, K meson mixing, basis vectors not aligning, C, P, CP eigenstates,
Dudley - Spontaneous CPV, vacuum not being invarient?
