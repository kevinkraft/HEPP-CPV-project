Revised simplified notes:

Read ! Intro.pdf, it is simple to start off with.


Basically:

No-more explicit CPV.
instead, happens due to symmetry breaking (like Higgs)
called spontaneous CPV (SCPV).

Works similar to:
Overall phase not important in QM, but phase difference between energy eigenstates is.

Something like this phase difference appears and has physical significance.

This is analogous to the phase in the CKM matrix.



One simple example of SCPV has been proven wrong (by one of Kevin's referenced papers).
