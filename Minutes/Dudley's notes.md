Right.



Spontaneous CPV
----------------
! INTRO pdf (powerpoint presentation) is good for the gist.


Like most 'extra' CPV in new physics it is aimed at explaining the anti-matter/matter ratio, by introducing "more" CPV.

Like most new physics, it has never been observered.

Said to be "natural."
Induced by the vaccuum. "the vacuum is no longer invariant." Presumably meaning if we have no quanta present we can still get CPV.

Vast amounts of research devoted to it.

Difficult to implement in SUSY theories and impossible in MSSM (Minimum Supersymmetric Standard Model). Also vast amount of research and approaches for non-spontaneous solutions inthese models.

I use vast and I mean VAST. Some papers are quite daunting in their presupposed knowledge, even introductions.




Groups in particle physics introduction
----------------------------------------
Let it first be said that the structures we deal with are not merely groups. That does not happen in physics.

In physics geometry is essential.

The structure we deal with are Lie groups, which are also differentiable manifolds. (No one need worry if they are not 100% on what this means)

In maths we can combine structures easily:
A Ring is Semi group (multiplication) and a group (addition)
A Field is a group (multiplication) and a group (addition)
A vector space is a group (addition) and a scalar multiplication.

What is more interesting is combining algebraic and geometric objects:
A norm-space is a vector space with a concept of length, this generates a metric which generates a topology.
An inner product space, similarly, has a concept of orthogonality. It also generates a norm -> metric -> topology.

We consider two of the most fundamental objects:
Groups (very simple algebra),  Topology (very simply geometry).

A topological group is a group where
group operator is continuous (g.h) = gh
inversion is continuous g->g^-1

A lie algebra, what we came here for in the first place, is one of these but we also add on calculus. So you can just think differential manifold instead of topology and 'differentiable' instead of continuous.

THE POINT???????????
These are not just groups, this is physics and as we expect the symmetries we need are geometric and calculus-y in nature.

Standard Model Group
--------------------
Groups represent (gauge) symmetries
Gauge symmetries are weirder than common symmetries like rotational symmetries.

Fields in standard model:
fermion field, psi.
electro weak: W1, W2, W3 B
gluon field G
Higgs phi

The gague group of the SM is
U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3)
where U(1) acts on B and phi
SU(2) acts on W and phi
SU(3) on G

We do need further understanding of what these groups are and it is not difficult to talk about them (at all) from a group theory perspective.

I will investigate differential manifold-y properties.

Is the Lagrangian uniquely determinable by the symmetries?
my guess: Probably not.


Groups in CPV
----------------------
Well, apparently the CKM matrix can be represented as euler angle rotations, so that is SO(3) instantly, but more interestingly in New physics models people talk about what different groups do to CPV.

I don't know enough about this yet, except that finite groups may be used.
That is weird. Certaintly finite groups are not differentialble manifolds (nothing finite can be locally like an open set in euclidean space, finite < uncountably infinite!!!)

peace out
