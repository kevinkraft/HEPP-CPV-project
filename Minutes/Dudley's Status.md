I will put my TeX into just \section format near the end.
(less temporary clutter this way.)

Give it a read if you're bored, let me know what you think.
Above all I don't want it to be too mathsy, but it needs explanation before I got into SCPV.

Haven't put in references, will do when deciding on order of report.
