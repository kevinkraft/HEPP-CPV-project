2-column format:
5.5 pages  (intro + prerequsite non-rigourous maths section)

1-column format.
7 pages!!!
I consider this too much, but, consider the ending sections (3-4 pages)



BATTLE PLAN:

SCPV detailed:
Talk about VEV (vacuum expectation value).
Show (or state) that vaccuum is invariant under CP in SM.

Talk about group conditiosn for SCPV
"What symmetries must a theory have for SCPV to be possible?"
 - example that SM does not have these conditions.
 - examples of various extensions that do thave it.

What sort of experiments could detail SCPV?

mini-conclusion (???)

(group condition is powerful tool for evaluating and creating new theories yadda yadda)
