I think my section is done (9.5 pages)

Things worked out pretty great!

One of the example SCPV theories, aspons (very close to the SM) actually has made an experimental prediction (1998) which does not work with an experimental value obtained in Kevin's section (2013).

That is: Aspons is proven wrong! Quite cool to see real science.
SCPV still stands as it is a very general principle, but one of the more basic extensions to the standard model I discussed does not!

I feel like this really ties the sections together. (at least more than they were).


To do:
 - Proof read final pages
 - Feynman Diagrams in TeX
 - Read your guys stuff
