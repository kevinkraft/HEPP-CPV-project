PLEASE NOTE... Yep ill fix the spelling mistakiles in the morining also it'll look derpy as Im still trying to figure git out.

Quick Notes:

CPV in B-meson/B-meson mixing :
The principal of neutral B mixing is similar to the  Kaons except with an b and d instead of the s and d.(i.e. most of what kevin has referenced from (M&S)).Also have found a work-though of CP invarince in a time-dependent schrondinger equation way by ref[1]. Small CP violation derived from an amplitude ratio between the hermitian part of the hamiltonian (Mass matrix) and the anti-hermitian part of the hamiltonian (decay amplitude).However there a very long paper dedicated to these two Factors of CPV and its ref[2]. Its somewhat important to note the Bella and BaBar results and comparsion and why some decay chains have been surpresed. Domain planes, triangles and penguines are all nifty visually. The surving B and K meson in CP violations instead of their 'bared' buddies has lead to an explination to the matter domainance of the earlier universe, well at least one 10 millionth of it!

FLavour changing neutral process:
This is the process of changing the falavor of a fermion without altering the electric charge. For example we may have a strage s quark (1/3) change to a down quark (1/3) and the emmission of a z boson. This process is forbidden mainly by the GIM mechanism but can still presist in certain decays at low amplitudes. Since this is measurable through experimental results it provides a testing ground for the unitarity  $V_CKM*V_CKM^† = 1$ of the CKM matrix. One of these in particiular is the Neural B meson mixed state and to some extent Kaon mixing and that by accounting for all available decay route can the mixing angles be deterimed and compared to ckm model data.

GIM to CKM
Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiana. GIM is a mechanisim that surpresses FCNC. It was developement that lead to the prediction of the charm quark. By assuming first that a doublet of quarks will exist with its top row containing the charm and the bottem a mixture of up and down. WHen the charged current piece is obtained and a neutral Z0 term is parted from the EM part we have a system no longer containg the new quark. Fundamantaly this means the FCNC terms have disappeared. Given that the mass of the up and charm are different we produce a new interaction coefficent. ref[3] Important to note the mass contributions to determining final states in CKM usage. Top quark mass is a particular nusance especially in contributing terms on Kaon. Consequencly we end up with a system where our predicted results depend on the generations of quarks available in the standard model. Another Test of CKM matrix can be through FCCC (flavour changed charges current)


Strong CP problem
Why is the strong force seem to not break CP symmetry. QCD allows for a possible violation of this term. A rather interesting unsolved problem in particle physics with either trivial results or some seeming large implications. There is a theta parameter in the lagrangian that had usually been ignored due to the lack of physical implications by being divergent, this is the leading cause of a possible CPV in QCD [4]. A completer run through of this on the lagrangian and in relation to a the smallness of theta and scale of symmetry breaking. The model also predicts a particle that may facilate this called the axion. Such particles inevitably
appear in string theory and in supersymmetric field theories. Of which I just going to peer into Susy.
