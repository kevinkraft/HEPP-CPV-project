Second meeting

Some Reveleations
-----------------
From paper "CPV dominant matter ???"
* CPV first observed in Kaon system
* Kaons(lightest strange quark meson) produced by strong force and decay by weak force
* Strange quark (Kaon constituent) can't decay by strong as strong conserves strange, so it must decay by weak
