first meeting

Topics
------
* Need to talk about Partiy, Charge conjugation and their violation
* New physics sources of CPV (beyond the standard model)
* Cosmology matter anti matter difference (need new physics)
* LHCb (shape, how they find CPV with the detector)
* Mixing. Neutrino mixing (good example), B and D, K mixing. 
* Types of CPV, Direct(because of particles decaying to same final states in different ways ????check this), indirect(because of mixing). 
* CPV in electroweak
* Any Higgs Boson connections?
