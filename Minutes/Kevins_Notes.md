CPV
---
* Direct
  * asymmetry in branching ratio due to quantum interference between two paths of decay
  * ``The situation can be compared to rolling two dice â€“ say, a blue die for a B and a red one for an anti-B.  To take the comparison further, suppose that getting K+pi- from a B corresponded to the blue die landing on 1, while getting a K-pi+ from an anti-B were like getting the red die on 6. In a symmetric world, by rolling both dice a million times one would expect to get 1s from the blue as often as one gets 6s from the red.
  * See figure 5 in Kaon_CPV_Zeng for two fenymann diagrams of two direct CPV processes in kaon system

But the weak force has a preference, as if its dice were loaded.''

* Indirect
  * From mixing due to basis vectors not aligning with particle and anti particle states, quantum interference between these states
 
Electroweak
-----------
* Conditions for electroweak unification (Martin and Shaw pg253)
  1. unification condition
  2. anomoly condition
* Weak mixing angle can be calculated from rates of charged and neutral EM current reactions


CPV in Kaon system/Kaon Mixing
-----------------------------

* Section Layout:
  * 1, 2 use C, P CP operator maths in (M+S) and from lecture notes, 

----------------------------
1.Two Neutral Kaon states
  * K0 (d)(s^bar), K0^bar (s)(d^bar)
  * Weak doesn't conserve strangeness so these can decay to one another by (Martin and Shaw, 10.8 pg 289)
  * In fact there is no quantum number conservation violated(for weak decay) in going from one to the other as for similar decays involving other particles and anti particles
  * Kaon has P=-1
* Indirect CPV (i.e. mixing)
2 CP eigen states of K0 K0^bar are K0_1=symmetric lin.comb, K0_2=antisymmetric lin.comb (D'Ambrosio Kaon review has calc of this)
  * K0_1 -> CP=1 states (ex. K0_1->pi pi), K0_2 -> CP=-1 states (ex. K0_2->pi pi pi), for CP conservation (M+S pg 290)
4. Kaon Regeneration (I might use this to introduce the K0_S and KO_L as lin.combs of K0_1 and K0_2)
    * See also Kaon_CPV_Zeng.pdf (Do not reference)
    * comes about due to kaon mixing and K0_L and K0_S lifetimes.
    *In beam of K0_L and K0_S, all K0_S decay after a certain time, so only K0_L should be observed, but found that some K0_S observed (Regeneration of Neutral K Mesons and their Mass Difference. With R. Good et al. Phys. Rev. 124, 1223 (1961).)
    3. Strangeness Oscillations (m+s PG 300, Kaon_CPV_Zeng)
      	* Related to Kaon regeneration
        * Due to weak force violating strangeness
	* Used to determine the mass difference
* Observed neutral Kaons are K0_s "short", K0_L "long" 
  * AS K0_s -> 2pi => CP=1, K0_L -> 2pi => CP=-1, we can say, if CP conserved then K0_S=K0_1, K0_L=K0_2
  * But K0_L (CP=-1)-> pi+ pi- (CP=1) observed by Christenson, Cronin, Fitch, Turlay (1964) "Evidence for the 2pi Decay of the K^2_0 Meson" (M+S pg 292) (J. H. Christenson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 13 (1964) 138)
  * This implies K0_L and K0_S are not entirely aligned with the basis states (M+S eq 10.33 pg 294)

* Kaon CPV in semi-leptonic
  * No direct CPV in these channels (D'Ambrosio Kaon review pg 12)

* Charged Kaon CPV
  * No mass mixing (d'ambrosio pg 13)
  * check if this has been observed (See also http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep--ph/0401236.pdf )

CKM Mechanism 
-------------
* Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
* CPV depends on phase of CKM matrix
* Essential: Quark Mixing (not part of "CKM mechanism" though)
  * lepton-quark symmetry
  * first two generations (u,d) (c,s) of quarks and leptons have identical weak interactios (not actually true yet) (M+S pg 226) 
  * Cabbibo said real quarks are lin.combs of other quark states (just like in Kaon system)
  * (u,d') (c,s') (M+S 8.15) with d'=d*cos(theta_C)+s*sin(theta_C), cos(theta_C)>sin(theta_C)  
  * This gives cabbibo favoured and cabbibo suppresed decays. Favoured have a cos(theta_C), suppressed have a sin(theta_C)
    * Reason why charm hadrons almost always go to strange hadrons
  * In three generations mixing happens between d,s,t, the extension for the top quark was made by K. and M.. CKM matrix is unitary (M+S pg 236)
* CKM matrix can be paramterized in many ways (M+S pg 304 eqn 10.56)
  * Contains imaginary terms, T operator involes complx conjugate => T violation, assuming CPT conservation (Necessary for validity of Lorentz transformation (check)) => CP violation
