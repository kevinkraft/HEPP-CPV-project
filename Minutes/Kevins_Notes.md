Kevin's Notes

CPV
---
* Direct
  * asymmetry in branching ratio due to quantum interference between two paths of decay
  * ``The situation can be compared to rolling two dice â€“ say, a blue die for a B and a red one for an anti-B.  To take the comparison further, suppose that getting K+pi- from a B corresponded to the blue die landing on 1, while getting a K-pi+ from an anti-B were like getting the red die on 6. In a symmetric world, by rolling both dice a million times one would expect to get 1s from the blue as often as one gets 6s from the red.

But the weak force has a preference, as if its dice were loaded.''

* Indirect
  * From mixing due to basis vectors not aligning with particle and anti particle states, quantum interference between these states
 
Electroweak
-----------
* Conditions for electroweak unification (Martin and Shaw pg253)
  1. unification condition
  2. anomoly condition
* Weak mixing angle can be calculated from rates of charged and neutral EM current reactions


CPV in Kaon system/Kaon Mixing
-----------------------------
* Two Neutral Kaon states
  * K0 (d)(s^bar), K0^bar (s)(d^bar)
  * Weak doesn't conserve strangeness so these can decay to one another by (Martin and Shaw, 10.8 pg 289)
  * In fact there is no quantum number conservation violated(for weak decay) in going from one to the other as for similar decays involving other particles and anti particles
  * Kaon has P=-1
* Indirect CPV (i.e. mixing)
* CP eigen states of K0 K0^bar are K0_1=symmetric lin.comb, K0_2=antisymmetric lin.comb
  * K0_1 -> CP=1 states (ex. K0_1->pi pi), K0_2 -> CP=-1 states (ex. K0_2->pi pi pi), for CP conservation (M+S pg 290)
* Observed neutral Kaons are K0_s "short", K0_L "long" 
  * AS K0_s -> 2pi => CP=1, K0_L -> 2pi => CP=-1, we can say, if CP conserved then K0_S=K0_1, K0_L=K0_2
  * But K0_L -> pi+ pi- (CP=1) observed by Christenson, Cronin, Fitch, Turlay (1964) (M+S pg 292)
