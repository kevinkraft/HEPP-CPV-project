\section{Conclusion}

This review has presented the current state of CPV through the CKM theory, experimental evidence, group formalism and cosmological models.

As shown the first evidence for CPV in the neutral Kaon systems and subsequent discoveries in this sector are important verifications of CPV theory and also verify $CPT$ conservation. The current state of CPV in the charm sector has been discussed, showing that current measurements are not accurate enough to verify CPV in this system.
