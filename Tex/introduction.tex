Direct(asymmetry in branching ratio due to quantum interference between two paths of decay) and Indirect (From mixing due to basis vectors not aligning with particle and anti particle states, quantum interference between these states)

Direct:

``The situation can be compared to rolling two dice â€“ say, a blue die for a B and a red one for an anti-B.  To take the comparison further, suppose that getting K+pi- from a B corresponded to the blue die landing on 1, while getting a K-pi+ from an anti-B were like getting the red die on 6. In a symmetric world, by rolling both dice a million times one would expect to get 1s from the blue as often as one gets 6s from the red.

But the weak force has a preference, as if its dice were loaded.''
