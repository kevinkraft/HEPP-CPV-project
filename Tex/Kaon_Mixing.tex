\subsection{Neutral Kaon Mixing and $\hat{C}\hat{P}$V}

As mentioned $\hat{C}\hat{P}$V was first observed in the neutral kaon system. Direct and indirect $\hat{C}\hat{P}$V have been observed but it is found to be entirely dominated by the indirect process [Zeng, need better reference]. Essential to these mechanisms is the mixing between the neutral Kaon and its anti-particle corresponding to the states $\ket{K^{0}}$ and $\ket{\hat{K}^{0}}$. These have quark compositions of $d \bar{s}$ and $s \bar{d}$, respectively.
