$CP$ violation was first observed in the mixing of neutral K-mesons by Christenson, Cronin, Fitch and Turlay in 1964 \cite{FirstCPV}. They observed the $\hat{C}\hat{P} = -1$ state $K^{0}_L$ decaying to $2$ pions, a state with $\hat{C}\hat{P} = 1$. Although the fraction of $K^{0}_L$ decays violating $\hat{C}\hat{P}$ in this way is tiny, the discovery was significant.
